Area Type

Census 2021 statistics are published for a number of different geographies.
These can be large, for example the whole of England, or small, for example
an output area (OA), the lowest level of geography for which statistics are
produced.

For higher levels of geography, more detailed statistics can be produced.
When a lower level of geography is used, such as output areas (which have
a minimum of 100 persons), the statistics produced have less detail. This is
to protect the confidentiality of people and ensure that individuals or their
characteristics cannot be identified.


Coverage

Census 2021 statistics are published for the whole of England and Wales.
However, you can choose to filter areas by:

- country - for example, Wales
- region - for example, London
- local authority - for example, Cornwall
- health area – for example, Clinical Commissioning Group
- statistical area - for example, MSOA or LSOA


Protecting personal data

Sometimes we need to make changes to data if it is possible to identify
individuals. This is known as statistical disclosure control.

In Census 2021, we:
- swapped records (targeted record swapping), for example, if a household 
  was likely to be identified in datasets because it has unusual
  characteristics, we swapped the record with a similar one from a nearby
  small area (very unusual households could be swapped with one in a nearby
  local authority)
- added small changes to some counts (cell key perturbation), for example,
  we might change a count of four to a three or a five – this might make
  small differences between tables depending on how the data are broken down
  when we applied perturbation
